# genius-stack-theme
Specialized WordPress Child Theme for [UnderStrap Theme Framework](https://github.com/understrap/understrap) designed to work as part of the [Genius Stack service by FatLab, LLC](https://thegeniusstack.com/).

## Overview
Genius Stack shares with the parent theme all PHP files and adds its own functions.php on top of the UnderStrap parent theme's functions.php.

**IT DOES NOT LOAD THE PARENT THEMES CSS FILE(S)!** Instead it uses the UnderStrap Parent Theme as a dependency via npm and compiles its own CSS file from it.

Genius Stack Child Theme uses the Enqueue method to load and sort the CSS file the right way instead of the old @import method.

## Installation
1. Install the parent theme UnderStrap first: [https://github.com/understrap/understrap](https://github.com/understrap/understrap)
   - IMPORTANT: If you download UnderStrap from GitHub make sure you rename the "understrap-master.zip" file to "understrap.zip" or you might have problems using this child theme!
2. Upload the genius-stack folder to your wp-content/themes directory
3. Go into your WP admin backend 
4. Go to "Appearance -> Themes"
5. Activate the Genius Stack theme
